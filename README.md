# üöΩ Bodily Functions | Project Zomboid
A mod for bodily functions in Project Zomboid.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
I own the rights to the assets that do not directly modify built in Project Zomboid assets.

Before contributing or creating derivatives of this mod, please read the following carefully:

# ‚ùå Do not reupload this mod
This mod is hosted officially here on GitHub, as well as the Steam workshop under the username "MonkeyShark". Do not reupload without my explicit permission.

# üí° Inspiration Policy
By uploading any addon(s), you agree that:

I may take inspiration from your work depending on the nature of the addon.
If you do not want me to use ideas from your addon (for bug fixes, extra features, etc.), then please do not create or upload the addon at all.

I enjoy collaborating with other modders and usually ask for permission before using someone‚Äôs code directly, usually out of principle. However, I don‚Äôt want to be in a situation where someone creates a fix, denies me access to it, and then accuses me of wrongdoing when I reimplement the same logic myself.

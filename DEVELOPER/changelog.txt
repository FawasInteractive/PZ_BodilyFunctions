-gotta make SelfUrinate SelfDefecate happen if using ground or toilet action ends too quickly

==============

-Simplified the UrinePuddle model by removing unnecessary faces. It is now a flat plane.
-Replaced the 3D model with a flat square plane, allowing for texture-based variations instead of relying on complex models.
-Introduced new textures for urine puddles:
	Hydrated texture (blue-er and clearer).
	Dehydrated texture (yellowish).
-Added Icons To Context Options
	Wash soiled clothing (uses PeedSelf texture)
	Pee in container (uses pee water bottle texture)
-Moved Bathroom_WasteProducts.txt models into Bathroom_Models.txt
-Added most (if not all) shorts to different list, meaning they will no longer show the peed jeans overlay.
-Renamed "Urine_Hydrated_0" to "Urine_Hydrated_0" and removed DisplayName
-Renamed "Urine_Hydrated_0" to "Urine_Hydrated_0" and removed DisplayName

-Thirst and Hunger Mechanics:
	Thirst and hunger levels now influence the production of urine and poop:
	Higher thirst/hunger slows down production.
	Lower thirst/hunger speeds it up.

-Increased the base urine production rate from 1% to 1.2% per cycle, making the system slightly faster.

-Added Traits: (Most are not yet fully implemented but will be worked on in future updates.)
	Bladder Traits:

	Small Bladder: "Bladder fills quicker and more urgently." (+1 points)
	Bedwetter: "Involuntary urination while asleep." (+3 points)
	Urinary Incontinence: "Poor bladder control in general." (+5 points)
	Paruresis: "Urination is difficult when near zombies or players." (+4 points)
	Shy Bladder: "Urination is difficult without using the toilet." (+6 points)
	Large Bladder: "Bladder takes longer to fill." (-1 point)
	Bladder Control: "75% chance to stop urination 5% of the way through peeing self." (-3 points)

	Bowel Traits:

	Small Bowels: "Bowels fill quicker and more urgently. (+1 points)
	Bedsoiler: "Involuntary defecation while asleep." (+3 points)
	Fecal Incontinence: "Poor bowel control in general." (+6 points)
	Parcopresis: "Defecation is difficult when near zombies or players." (+4 points)
	Shy Bowels: "Defecation is difficult without using the toilet." (+5 points)
	Large Bowels: "Bowels take longer to fill." (-1 point)
	Bowel Control: "75% chance to stop defecation 5% of the way through pooping self." (-3 points)

-Implemented Traits:
	Bedwetter: You will pee the bed if your bladder reaches near max value.
	Bedsoiler: You will poop the bed if your bowels reach near max value.

-Urgency Hiccup System:
	-Depending on your character's current mood and how full your bladder or bowels are, you might experience a "hiccup" of urgency. This could be a small reminder to go, or an unexpected accident.
	-Currently the only modifiers are "Panic" (increases chance of hiccup, doesn't impact accident chance yet), and "Drunkenness" (increases accident chance)
	-When you feel a sudden urgency, game speed slows down for a better reaction time.
	-The function that manages sudden accidents (formerly "CheckForAccident") is now renamed to HandleInstantAccidents. It triggers accidents in very sudden situations like being injured or overflowing bladder or bowels.
	-Hiccup chance is always 0 when sleeping, but as listed above, bedwetters and bedsoilers are still not safe.

-Cleaning Urine Puddles
	-Removed from inventory (as in not visible)
	-They cannot be picked up with the Grab function
	-They can be cleaned with either a Mop, Dish Towel, Bath Towel, or Toilet Brush

- Pee & Poop beans for debug
- Every sandbox option with "*" is unimplemented. implement these
- Nausea and discomfort for as long as the player wears pooped clothing
- Discomfort for as long as the player wears peed clothing
- Use PlayLoopedSoundTillComplete for SelfUrinate and SelfDefecate

- Anti-Diarrhea, Laxatives, Diuretic pills
- Liquid laxative and diuretic should actually impact poop and pee production
- Containers for liquid laxative and diuretic
- Pee in bottles
- Filter out pee bottle
- Make filtered urine liquid give nausea but safe to drink
- All underwear defined in BathroomClothOverlays
- Realistic stomach volume w/ liquid and food contents that convert into bladder and bowels meters
- Pee when pooping on the toilet
- Require wiping with paper, tissues, tp, etc. otherwise putting pants / underwear back on causes 5% pooped
- Require females wiping with paper, tissues, tp, etc. otherwise putting pants / underwear back on causes 2% peed
- Replace bathroom moodles to use urge rather than bladder / bowels capacity. So it can be dynamically changed to show how close you are to going.
